* Overview

Polyclot is a tool to draw interactive charts in CLIM. Purpose of this
document is to provide information how to draw and how to create new
types of charts. Tool may be used by other CLIM applications as a
library or as a standalone utility to render charts.

Only parts of the API are marked as stable and won't change in the
future. Everything else is experimental and may change without prior
notice.

* Standalone utility

All charts may be rendered with a ~FORMAT-CHART~ function. For
instance to render a simple line chart with two data series evaluate
in a REPL the following snippet:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (format-chart '((1 2 3 4 5)
                  (1 2 4 8 16))
                :chart-type :line)
  ;; Amazing physics going on...
#+END_SRC

The first argument is a list of series to be drawn. How each serie is
interpreted depends on a chart type. In this particular case elements
are consecutive y values (and x is assumed to start at 0 with step 1).

~:chart-type~ argument allows to specify a desired chart. Function
accepts other keyword arguments which depend on a chart type. Range
for X and Y axis in this example are inferred automatically but in
principle each serie may have its own scale, scale and step (for
functions).

Another typical use of the library is to plot a function. We need to
specify the X range and step.

* Embedding in a CLIM application
** As a frame
** As a pane
** As an output record
   
* Extending Polyclot

Polyclot is a tool to present data which comes in series. Each serie
has one or more dimensions and each dimension has properties: a label,
minimum and maximum value, major and minor ticks and a scaling
function. Serie have a name and objects. Each object has a position.
